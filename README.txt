This is my very first game on the Unity engine, so there may be many 
mistakes that I constantly made during development. At the time of 
development, a clear idea: "what will the game be?" I did not have. 
At the moment it is a regular clicker.

Purpose of the game: to earn as much money as possible 
for "Anatoly" - the main hero of the game. In addition to 
earning money, you need to monitor the indicators of "Food" 
and "Electricity". In the course of earning money, you also 
increase your level, the higher the level, the longer it 
takes to get a new level.

You only lose if you run out of money or food or 
electricity. For now, that's all my game is.
